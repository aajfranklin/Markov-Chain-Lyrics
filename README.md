# Markov Chain Lyrics

**Project Background**

A simple programme to test self-taught Python knowledge beyond the confines of online code editors. Made before committing to full-time education in computer science.

Employs external modules for Markov chain text generation (Codecademy's markov_python), web-scraping (urllib2), and text-to-speech (win32com.client).

**Programme Summary**

Run from the command line, the programme provides text prompts for the user to select a word and one or more Radiohead albums. It displays song lyrics generated from the user's chosen word, in the style of the user's chosen album(s), and "sings" the song using Microsoft speech engine.
